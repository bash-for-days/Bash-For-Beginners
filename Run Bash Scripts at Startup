This is a simple guide to list various ways to run bash scripts at startup:

### Create your startup script using a terminal file editor such as Nano: 

	nano

### Add commands or a script you want to run at startup:

	#!/bin/bash
	echo “ It worked!” 

### Save the script in Nano:

Press [Ctrl + X] key, then press [Y] to confirm and [Enter] return to the terminal.

[In this example we will save our as “Startup.sh” in case you we already have startup.sh in the folder we are placing it in]

### Move the file from your home folder to /etc/init.d/:

	sudo mv ~/Startup.sh  /etc/init.d/

### Make the script executable:

	sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/Startup.sh

### Set the file to run at startup:

	sudo update-rc.d Startup.sh enable

### Reboot your device:

	sudo reboot

### Confirm the script was executed at startup:

A terminal window should be open with the message “ It works” printed. 

If you wish to replace this message with useful commands see our useful commands page for useful commands and usage to modify your startup script.
